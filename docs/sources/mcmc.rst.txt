Markov Chain Monte Carlo
========================

Monte Carlo simulations are just a way of estimating a fixed parameter by repeatedly generating random numbers. More details can be found at `A Zero Math Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods`_. 

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to approximate the posterior distribution of a parameter of interest by random sampling in a probabilistic space. More details can be found at `A Zero Math Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods`_.
